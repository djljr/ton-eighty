## Development

I'm trying to use [LightTable][2] (version 0.4.11) as the primary development platform. If you open up the directory in the workspace,
you can eval a line from the core.clj file to connect to the project. Once you do that you can start a repl (`ctrl-space` then `Instarepl`).

Now you can use in-line evaluation of commands each line will eval as you type, for instance:

```clojure
(require '[hiccup.core :as h])

(h/html [:h1 "Hello World"])
```
